Program Description: 
Open CSV of exam grades into numpy array. Find the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam, then
	find the same for all exams combined, next find the number of students who passed each exam with a 60 or more, then
	find the pass percentage for all exams combined.

Functions used in the Program (list in order as they are called):
1. Function Name: main
     Description: Open CSV in numpy array, then run exam1, exam2, exam3, all_exams, and ex_pass 
     Parameters: N/A 
     Variables: g - numpy array containing CSV data
     Logical Steps: 
	1. Read npgrades.csv into numpy array 'g' with data type of floating point
	2. Print first three rows of 'g'
	3. Run exam1, exam2, exam3, all_exams, and ex_pass
     Returns: The results from numpy array data analysis

2. Function Name: exam1  
     Description: Data analysis of first column of 'g' (Exam 1 grades)
     Parameters: g -  numpy array containing CSV data 
     Variables:
	ex1_mean - Calculates the mean of first column
	ex1_med - Calculates the median of the first column
	ex1_std - Calculates the standard deviation of the first column
	ex1_min - Finds the minimun score of the first column
	ex1_max - Finds the maximum score of the first column
     Logical Steps:  
	1. Find the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for first column
	2. Print results
     Returns: Results of data analysis of the first exam (first column)

3. Function Name: exam2
     Description: Data analysis of second column of 'g' (Exam 2 grades)
     Parameters: g -  numpy array containing CSV data 
     Variables:
	ex2_mean - Calculates the mean of second column
	ex2_med - Calculates the median of the second column
	ex2_std - Calculates the standard deviation of the second column
	ex2_min - Finds the minimun score of the second column
	ex2_max - Finds the maximum score of the second column
     Logical Steps:  
	1. Find the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for second column
	2. Print results
     Returns: Results of data analysis of the second exam (second column)

4. Function Name: exam3
     Description: Data analysis of second column of 'g' (Exam 3 grades)
     Parameters: g -  numpy array containing CSV data 
     Variables:
	ex3_mean - Calculates the mean of third column
	ex3_med - Calculates the median of the third column
	ex3_std - Calculates the standard deviation of the third column
	ex3_min - Finds the minimun score of the third column
	ex3_max - Finds the maximum score of the third column
     Logical Steps:  
	1. Find the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for third column
	2. Print results
     Returns: Results of data analysis of the third exam (third column)

5. Function Name: all_exams
     Description: Data analysis of entire 'g' array (All exam grades)
     Parameters: g -  numpy array containing CSV data 
     Variables:
	all_mean - Calculates the mean of entire array
	all_med - Calculates the median of the entire array
	all_std - Calculates the standard deviation of the entire array
	all_min - Finds the minimun score of the entire array
	all_max - Finds the maximum score of the entire array
     Logical Steps:  
	1. Find the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for entire array
	2. Print results
     Returns: Results of data analysis of all exams (entire array)

6. Function Name: ex_pass

     Description: Analysis entire array for passing scores of 60 percent or greater, add them up
	for each exam, then get the overall passing percentage for all exams
     Parameters: g -  numpy array containing CSV data 
     Variables:
	ex1_pass: Array of boolean integers for each element in column 1 that are 60 or greater
	ex1_pass_sum: Total number of passing scores in column 1
	ex2_pass: Array of boolean integers for each element in column 2 that are 60 or greater
	ex2_pass_sum: Total number of passing scores in column 2
	ex3_pass: Array of boolean integers for each element in column 3 that are 60 or greater
	ex3_pass_sum: Total number of passing scores in column 3
	all_pass: Array of boolean integers for each element for entire array that are 60 or greater
	all_pass_sum: Total number of passing scores for entire array
	
     Logical Steps:  
	1. Find number of passing scores for each exam and all exams combined.
	2. Print results
     Returns: Number of passing scores of each exam and all exams combined
