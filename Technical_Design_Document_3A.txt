Program Description: 
Monthly Expenses: 
	A program that asks the user to enter their monthly expenses (both type and
how much). Then after the user enters all of them, the program analyzes and displays 
the total cost of all of the expenses, the most costly expense, and the lease costly 
expense.
---

Logical Steps:  
1. Ask user to enter expense type and cost of that expense, and append their entry
	into the list. Repeat until user has entered all of their expenses.
2. Analyze the expenses list and calculate the total cost of the expenses
3. Calculate the most costly expense
4. Calculate the least costly expense
5. Display results.
---

Variables:  
1. exp_list: List containing user-inputted expenses
2. exp_type: User input expense type
3. exp_cost: User input expense cost
4. end: loops enter_exp function. If user enters "yes" or "y", then run analyze_exp function
5. exp_sum: calculates total cost of expenses in exp_list
6. highest: calculates highest expense
7. lowest: calculates lowest expense

Functions:
1. Function Name: enter_exp 
   Description: Function that asks the user to enter the type and amount of each expense and 
	adds them into thelist. 
   Parameters:

   Description: Calculates the most costly expense in exp_list
   Parameters: exp_list: list containing all entered expenses
   Returns: Prints most costly expense and how much it costs
5. Function Name: low_exp
   Description: Calculates the least costly expense in exp_list
   Parameters: exp_list: list containing all entered expenses
   Returns: Prints least costly expense and how much it costs
6. Function Name: main
   Description: Runs enter_exp
   Parameters:
   Returns: Runs enter_exp
